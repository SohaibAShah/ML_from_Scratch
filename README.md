# Machine Learning from Scratch

This repository is a collection of Python implementations of various supervised learning algorithms. The goal of this project is to provide a clear and concise understanding of how these algorithms work from the ground up.

## Supervised Learning
### Linear Regression:

A fundamental regression algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
It assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. Â  

### Logistic Regression:

A classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on input features.
It uses the sigmoid function to map the output to a probability between 0 and 1.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

A simple yet powerful classification and regression algorithm that classifies new data points based on the majority vote of their nearest neighbors.
The value of K determines the number of neighbors to consider.

### Decision Trees:

A tree-based model that makes decisions by splitting the data based on feature values.
It can handle both classification and regression tasks.

### Random Forest:

An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
It reduces overfitting and increases model robustness.

## How to Use
Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch.git
Use code with caution.

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.
Run the Code: Execute the Python scripts for each algorithm to train and evaluate the models on your own datasets.
